Primary is a Vim color scheme based on Google's colors. 

For SCREENSHOTS (and much more), see 
https://github.com/google/vim-colorscheme-primary

Primary contains settings for both light and dark backgrounds. It's is fun, 
very readable, and Google-inspired.

The Gui version uses the exact RGB codes from Google's logo. Primary on a
256-color terminal looks very similar and even 8-color terminals are supported.

Disclaimer: This is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise),
it is just code that happens to be owned by Google.
